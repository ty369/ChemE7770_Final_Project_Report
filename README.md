This folder contians:
1. The actual written report.
2. Three subfolder(nsp1, nsp10, and RdRp) for sequence sepcific modeling. Coding template is obtained from Varner Lab.
3. Two Excel files: "AASort" contains information about amino acid breakdown for each of the three COVID19 protein, and data about productivity;
                    "Nsp1 Expression with Time Dependency" contains information about nsp1 protein varies with time and its inhibition effects on GFP-ssrA.
4. Presentation sildes.

Note: 
1. The original sequence specific modeling contain calculation for energy efficiency that we did not mention in this study. 
2. To run the Sequence Specific Modeling, change Julia pathway to the coresponding folder, and run the "Solve.jl" file. 
   To chnage cases or promoter type, one can change the option in the Solive.jl file.
